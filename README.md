# Missing Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for invalid input in route parameters.  The `bug.js` file showcases a vulnerable route that doesn't check for invalid user IDs, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The `/users/:id` route directly accesses user data based on the `id` parameter. If an invalid or nonexistent ID is provided, the application may throw an error, return an unexpected response, or even crash. 

## Solution

Proper error handling is crucial. The solution includes checks to validate the `id` parameter and handle cases where the user is not found. A 404 (Not Found) response is returned in such cases.
